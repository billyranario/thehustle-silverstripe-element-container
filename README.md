# Installation

Install the module via Composer:

```bash
composer require thehustle/silverstripe-element-container
```

This command installs its dependencies as well, including the `dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental` module and `dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental-list` module so you don't have to install them separately.

After installation, you will need to run `http://yourdomain.com/dev/build` or `http://yourdomain.com/dev/build?flush=all` to create the database tables and flush the cache.
